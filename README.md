## Introduction

We have organized and translated this sample project and USubWindow script for ease of use.
However, please note that translations other than Japanese may be difficult to read due to machine translation.

## Overview
A simple Unity Editor window layout extension tool that implements a subform system primarily based on a tree structure and uses reflection to get how each window is drawn. It is convenient because you can draw a subwindow just by adding an attribute.

[EWSubWindow("SunWinA", EWSubWindowIcon.Game)]
private void SubWinA(Rect main)
{

}

[EWSubWindow("Grid", EWSubWindowIcon.Game, true, SubWindowStyle.Grid)]
private void SubWinA(Rect main)
{
	if (GUI.Button(new Rect(main.x, main.y, 100, 20), "Btn"))
	{

}
